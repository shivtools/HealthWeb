          | Consider this scenario. A patient goes to the doctor to get treatment for his various ailments. His arthritis is acting up as well as his asthma, along with many other conditions. Most of these conditions are more severe than usual. As the doctor is checking him out, they begin to chat until the patient starts talking about his living condition. It turns out, the patient is poorer and cannot afford heating in the winter months and there is mold covering his walls everywhere, but he cannot afford to get rid of it. Had it not been for his living conditions, these conditions would not have acted up. The doctor mentions that getting put in a new living condition instead of prescribing medicine would be better. However, the patient cannot afford it, what do we do?
